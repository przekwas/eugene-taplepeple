				Fate is a cruel mistress. That&apos;s how the saying goes. It&apos;s said to be an inevitable
				influence that is not only hazardous, but can be oblivious to the feelings of those
				it affects. But what if she just ... forgot about you? Where your life is just
				incredibly unremarkable. Totally average. Forgettable. You&apos;d want some kind of
				extreme good or bad twist of Fate just to know the universe hasn&apos;t completely left
				you behind.
			</p>
			<p className="pb-4">
				That&apos;s the story of Eugene Taplepeple. A 3&apos;2&quot; gnome who Fate let slip through her
				fingers. He&apos;s the son of two unremarkable parents, who run a slowly failing general
				store in an average sized village. It seems as though his destiny is to decompose
				along with the store. Running the family business. Nothing really to run. Days can
				go by without a soul entering the doors. Eugene&apos;s included when he works there. If
				by some miracle someone does come in, Eugene&apos;s stature and shyness may as well
				render him invisible. Sales lost because he&apos;d rather hide than interact. Maybe it
				was a subtle rebellion. A way for the store to fail. Maybe this is his way out.

				The most extraordinary thing to ever happen to his town was a visit by THE famous
				bard. Tito Dusktoe. Yes, that one. He was playing a show, and Eugene wanted nothing
				more than to attend. But for that you need money. And for that he needed customers.
				Might as well sprout wings and learn to fly. Better chance for that to happen.
				Eugene stood outside the town&apos;s largest tavern while Tito played. Standing in the
				rain, with his head hung low. Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the
				scene. Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream: he heard one lute riff,
				and it just blew him away.
			</p>
			<p className="pb-4">
				The very next day, he went to a secondhand store. He didn&apos;t know what he was looking
				for. But he knew when he&apos;d find it. And sure enough, there it was, one top hat.
				Didn&apos;t know how to pay for it, but he knew for sure. That one top hat felt good in
				his hands. And it didn&apos;t take long for him to understand ...
