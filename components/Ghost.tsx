				Just one top hat sitting on his head. It was his one way ticket. With only one way
				to go. So he grabbed it an ran. He ran from the secondhand store, from his parents
				store, and from who he was. He begged for coin in the first big city he got to.
				Worked odd jobs for spare change, and earned every copper he got his hands on. He
				used it to buy his first lute. And something about the combination of the top hat,
				the lute, and ... whoever this new person was, could not be stopped. An unstoppable
				force. His fingers just shredded down the fretboard of the lute. Where did this
				power come from? Was it in him all along?

				Eugene knew the quiet, meek, and shy gnome from his past was only going to weigh him
				down. So he ditched it when the hat came on. He became ethereal. A mysterious
				musical figure. Like a <b>Ghost</b>. That was it. His new persona. <b>Ghost</b>.
			</p>
			<p className="pb-4">
				He never took payment for his gigs. He never hung out with groupies. He never
				accepted the free food or drinks offered by the venues. His sole payment was this
				new life, and the magical power of his unique music. The art of it all was{' '}
				<i>everything</i> to him. And so he chases the next high. Looking to use his musical
				magic to do some good. So there&apos;s only one thing to do.
